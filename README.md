# A Collection of Awesome Java Snippets

Curated Java snippets for your coding pleasure.

This repo collects idiomatic Java snippets that you may find useful. Snippets collected here are:

* **curated**. They are idiomatic and of high quality;
* **specific**. They solve one task and do it well;
* **reusable**. They are self-contained and well-documented.

All snippets are in **public domain**. Using them whichever way you want. A good analogy is that you'd use these snippets the same way you'd quote Shakespeare.
